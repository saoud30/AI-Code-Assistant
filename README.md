# üñ•Ô∏è Versatile Code Assistant

Versatile Code Assistant is an AI-powered tool that helps you generate code and answer programming-related questions. It supports multiple programming languages and allows users to switch between **Code Generation** and **Conversation** modes.

This project leverages the **Groq API** for generating code based on user inputs. The application is built using **Streamlit**, allowing it to be run as a web application.

## üåü Features

- Generate code in different programming languages (Python, C, C++).
- Choose from various versions of languages like Python, GCC, etc.
- Engage in conversation mode to ask programming-related questions.
- Clean and responsive user interface with both text input and chat-based interactions.
- Streamlit-powered web app with Groq API integration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for the app.
- **Streamlit**: Web framework for building the user interface.
- **Groq API**: Used to handle AI-based code generation and conversation.
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables securely.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- [Groq API Key](https://groq.com/) (You'll need to sign up and get your API key)
- Git

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal and clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Code-Assistant.git
   cd AI-Code-Assistant
Create a Virtual Environment

It‚Äôs a good practice to create a virtual environment for your project. Run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
.\venv\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
Install Dependencies

Use pip to install the required dependencies from requirements.txt:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Create .env File

You need to create an .env file to store sensitive information like your Groq API key. You can use the provided .example.env file as a reference.

bash
Copy code
cp .example.env .env
Then, open the .env file and add your Groq API key:

bash
Copy code
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Run the Application

Now, you're ready to run the application:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
This command will launch the app locally in your default web browser. The app will be accessible at http://localhost:8501.

üìñ Usage
1. Code Generation Mode
Step 1: Choose Code Generation mode from the mode selector.
Step 2: Enter a specific prompt describing the code you need.
Step 3: Select the desired programming language (e.g., Python, C, C++).
Step 4: Choose the language version.
Step 5: Click Generate Response and wait for the code to be generated.
2. Conversation Mode
Step 1: Select Conversation mode from the mode selector.
Step 2: Enter a question or prompt about programming.
Step 3: Click Generate Response to get answers related to your question.
Step 4: Alternatively, you can use the chat input at the bottom for a more conversational experience.
üíª Example Prompts
Here are some examples of prompts you can use:

Code Generation Mode:
Python Prompt: "Generate Python code to read a CSV file and calculate the sum of a column."
C++ Prompt: "Write C++ code that implements a binary search algorithm."
Conversation Mode:
"What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?"
"How does memory management work in C++?"
üõ°Ô∏è Environment Variables
The application uses the following environment variables, managed securely through the .env file:

GROQ_API_KEY: Your Groq API key for accessing the code generation and conversation services.
Make sure to never expose your API key in the source code or public repositories. Use the .env file and make sure it's listed in .gitignore.

üéØ ## üéØ Future Enhancements

Here are some potential enhancements to consider for the Versatile Code Assistant:

1. **Support for More Programming Languages**:
   - Expand the code generation capabilities to include additional languages such as Java, JavaScript, Ruby, Go, and more.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Add user authentication (e.g., using OAuth) to allow users to save their preferences, history, and favorite code snippets.

3. **Code Formatting and Linting**:
   - Integrate code formatting and linting features to ensure that generated code adheres to style guides and best practices.

4. **Code Execution Environment**:
   - Provide a sandbox environment to run the generated code directly within the app, allowing users to see the output immediately.

5. **Code Snippet Library**:
   - Create a library of commonly used code snippets that users can easily access and insert into their code generation prompts.

6. **Dark Mode/Theme Customization**:
   - Add a toggle for dark mode or customizable themes to improve user experience.

7. **Documentation Generation**:
    - Automatically generate documentation for the code snippets based on comments and code structure, making it easier for users to understand the generated code.

8. **Integration with IDEs**:
   - Develop plugins for popular IDEs (like VSCode, PyCharm) that allow users to access the assistant's features directly within their coding environment.

9. **Custom Prompt Templates**:
    - Allow users to create and save custom prompt templates for common tasks, making it easier to generate code.

By implementing these enhancements, we can significantly increase the functionality and user experience of the Versatile Code Assistant, making it a more powerful tool for developers.
